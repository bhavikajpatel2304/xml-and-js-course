1. How to structure the data in previous activity in order to have Name/Hobbies for a group of 10 people?
Answer:

-> We have to wrap all 10 records into single main tag to structure the data for a group of 10 people.
Example: 

<Identitities>
    <Identity>  <!-- Identity 1 -->
    ...
    </Identity>
    <Identity>  <!-- Identity 2 -->
    ...
    </Identity>
    .
    .
    .
    <Identity>  <!-- Identity 10 -->
    ...
    </Identity>
</Identitities>
